# Combinatorial-Optimisation

I will try to build from scratch some of the most popular algorithms in combinatorial optimisation such as Simplex, Two-Phase Simplex, Dual Simplex and Branch and Bound (might even get to Network Linear Programming as well). Currently the following algorithms/models have been done:
* Simplex Method
